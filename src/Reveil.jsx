              The Uniform
            </h2>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "14px", lineHeight: "1.8" }}>
              School uniforms in South Korea have their roots in the early 20th
              century, particularly during the Japanese occupation. Initially
              introduced as a means of instilling discipline, they quickly
              became an emblem of conformity within a deeply hierarchical
              society.
              <br />
              <br />
              After the liberation in 1945, the uniform persisted. By the 1980s,
              it became a national debate symbolizing both control and equality.
              Despite the uniformity, schools began adopting unique styles to
              differentiate themselves while still maintaining the foundational
              elements: white shirts, plaid skirts or trousers, and blazers.
              <br />
              <br />
              Over time, these uniforms became icons of youth culture in South
              Korea. Heavily featured in dramas, K-pop culture, and
              advertisements, they are now both functional attire and fashion
              statements. Modern students even accessorize them creatively to
              express individuality within conformity.
              <br />
              <br />
              Today, the uniform reflects both tradition and modernity. It
              stands at the crossroads of education, social expectations, and
              cultural identity in Korean society.

                Historical Education
              </h2>
              <p style={{ fontSize: "14px", lineHeight: "1.8" }}>
                During the Joseon Dynasty, education was reserved for the elite.
                Confucian schools formed the backbone of Korean intellectual
                life. Children learned calligraphy, Chinese classics, and
                etiquette.
                <br />
                <br />
                Kim Hong-do‚Äôs artwork is one of the earliest visual records of
                common education in Korea. It humanizes a time when education
                was a luxury for most. His style captures not only the subjects
                but the very ethos of a society undergoing cultural
                transformation.
                <br />
                <br />
                The transition from such traditional schooling to modern-day
                education ‚Äî complete with uniforms and centralized curricula ‚Äî
                illustrates how far Korea has come. Yet, echoes of these values
                remain embedded in the modern system.
